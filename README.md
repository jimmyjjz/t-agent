# Terraria Boss Beater via Deep Reinforcement Learning
### Introduction
This project utilizes PPO(proximal policy optimization) to train an agent to defeat Terraria bosses. The agent learns via screen capture and rewards based off of the situation(default being damage taken), therefore possesses adaptivity. This allows training on any Terraria boss no matter if it is worm-type(Ex. Eater of Worlds), segmented(Ex. Skeletron), or singular(Ex. Eye of Cthulu) without any code changes. Thus, can be used with ease to explore possible play styles with different ingame equipment or for playtesting with different levels of competency against different bosses.

### Brief Overview on How it Works

### Setup
**Note: must have access to tModloader and Terraria**

First things first, Clone the repo.

Setup Gameside Training Mod:
1. Make a tModloader mod skeleton
2. Navigate to the folder of the mod skeleton you have created in the previous step and copy the contents of TBBTrainingMod_core into that folder(just copy paste and click replace files)
3. Replace "...\\settings.json" in line 8 of [SettingsAccesser](https://github.com/jimmyjjz/TBB-DRL/blob/main/TBBTrainingMod_core/SettingsAccesser.cs) with the path of [settings.json](https://github.com/jimmyjjz/TBB-DRL/blob/main/DRL_component/settings.json)

Setup Deep Reinforcement Learning:
1. Replace "...\\reward_accumulant.txt" of [settings.json](https://github.com/jimmyjjz/TBB-DRL/blob/main/DRL_component/settings.json) with the path of [reward_accumulant](https://github.com/jimmyjjz/TBB-DRL/blob/main/DRL_component/reward_accumulant.txt).txt
2. [Install python 3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3110/) or [use conda(python built-in)](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/stable/user-guide/getting-started.html) or [use pycharm(python built-in)(I am using this). I am using pycharm.](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/?section=windows). More options exist.
3. Install dependencies. If pip is not installed(will be installed if using conda or pycharm or most if not all venv), [install it](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/), and path via environmental variables.
```
pip install numpy==1.26.4 pillow==11.2.1 gymnasium==1.0.0 dxcam==0.0.5 pydirectinput==1.0.4 stable-baselines3==2.6.0
```

### How to Train and Run a Model
Run [train_model.py](https://github.com/jimmyjjz/TBB-DRL/blob/main/DRL_component/run_model.py) to train. Run [run_model.py](https://github.com/jimmyjjz/TBB-DRL/blob/main/DRL_component/run_model.py) to run. Make sure when running, an existing checkpoint is attempted to be used via [settings.json](https://github.com/jimmyjjz/TBB-DRL/blob/main/DRL_component/settings.json).

### Misc
While training and running works in whatever Terraria terrain, just in case you want a good orthrodox boss battle arena, one is provided [TBB-Environment World.wld](https://github.com/jimmyjjz/TBB-DRL/blob/main/TBB-Environment%20World.wld).

To play on this world just put [TBB-Environment World.wld](https://github.com/jimmyjjz/TBB-DRL/blob/main/TBB-Environment%20World.wld) into ...\\Terraria\\tModLoader\\Worlds
